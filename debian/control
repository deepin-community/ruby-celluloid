Description: actor-based concurrent object framework for ruby
 Celluloid provides a simple and natural way to build fault-tolerant concurrent
 programs in Ruby.
 .
 Celluloid enables people to build concurrent programs out of concurrent objects
 just as easily as they build sequential programs out of sequential objects.
 .
 Recommended for any developer, including novices, Celluloid should help ease
 your worries about building multithreaded Ruby programs.
